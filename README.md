## RazorDialog \- Complete Common Dialog Replacement


</div>

### Description

This is great! Its a very simple UserControl I created that completely replaces the mess of common dialog. For example, if you load my OCX into your program and you want to edit the font of a rich text box, all you need to is type "RazorDialog1.SetFont RichTextBox" -- thats it! just replace the name of RichTextBox with whatever your rich text box is called! I made common dialog so simple, you will never need to load it again. Please vote! Please give me credit if you use this is any of your programs. THIS WORKS ON WINDOWS9X MACHINES.
